=============================
Hello guys.

I've created this tool to explore the vulnerability of Webmin File Disclosure. (Webmin < 1.290 / Usermin < 1.220 - Arbitrary File Disclosure (Python))
This vuln cause a flaw in /unauthenticated of an LFI

It's not too complex to use, but it'll help you automating and getting files easier from the server.

I hope it helps.

TYpe: $python3 exploit.py to see how we use it

Thanks !!<

From you Friend, Xen00rw
